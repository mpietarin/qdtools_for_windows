 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * Imagine is a library, which provides classes and methods for
 *
 *   - Reading images in various formats.
 *   - Writing images in various formats.
 *   - Rendering various drawable objects onto images.
 *   - Handling GIS data (for example ESRI shapefiles).
 *   - Contouring 2D data into drawable path descriptions.
 *
 * The library uses some methods in the newbase library to handle
 * for example 2D data, but is mostly independent of for example
 * querydata and queryinfo formats. In other words, the user is
 * expected to build the application providing the interface with
 * the (possibly) meteorological data and this library. A basic example
 * of such an interface is the qdcontour program, which can be used
 * for example to draw contour images from querydata files.
 *
